# Changelog

All notable changes to Argos are recorded here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
— the REST and database contracts may still change incompatibly before
`v1.0.0`.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Impact analysis graph** (ADR-0013) — server-side dependency graph
  traversal from any CMDB entity. New endpoint
  `GET /v1/impact/{entity_type}/{id}?depth=2` walks FK relationships
  bidirectionally across all 9 entity types with 4 relation types
  (`contains`, `owns`, `hosts`, `binds`). Depth-limited to 1–3 hops.
  Interactive SVG diagram on every entity detail page with depth selector
  and click-to-navigate. Prometheus metrics:
  `argos_impact_queries_total`, `argos_impact_query_duration_seconds`.

### Changed

- **EOL Inventory redesign** — the EOL Dashboard is renamed to
  "End-of-Life Inventory". Table columns are grouped into "what we run"
  (Status, Product, Version, Patch, Entity, Cluster) and "what's
  available" (Latest Available, EOL Date, Checked) with a visual
  separator. Rows are highlighted red for EOL, orange for approaching
  EOL. Column renames: "Cycle" → Version, "Cycle Latest" → Patch.

- **`latest_available` field in EOL annotations** — the enricher now
  stores the newest version of the product published on endoflife.date
  (e.g. `1.32.3` when the entity runs `1.28`). Zero additional API
  calls — the data is already fetched.

### Upgrading

No breaking changes, no migrations. The impact endpoint is available
immediately after upgrade. EOL annotations are updated with the new
`latest_available` field on the next enrichment tick.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-20

Patch release on top of `v0.1.0` "Canopus". Adds the first two steps of
the ADR-0008 asset-management rollout (curated metadata on Namespace
and Node, including `hardware_model`) and fixes three UUID-instead-of-
name rendering bugs on detail pages. Schema is additive only; `v0.1.0`
→ `v0.1.1` is a straight `ARGOS_AUTO_MIGRATE=true` bump, no data
migration required.

### Added

- **Curated metadata on Namespace**
  ([#56](https://github.com/sthalbert/Argos/pull/56)) — `owner` /
  `criticality` / `notes` / `runbook_url` / `annotations` (JSONB)
  columns editable at `/ui/namespaces/:id` by editor / admin. The
  collector's `UpsertNamespace` leaves these columns alone on conflict
  so per-tick upserts can't clobber operator edits.
- **Curated metadata on Node + `hardware_model`**
  ([#57](https://github.com/sthalbert/Argos/pull/57)) — same five
  curated columns on nodes plus a free-form `hardware_model` field for
  bare-metal installs to record a server model alongside the cloud-shaped
  `instance_type` populated by the collector. Closes the SNC §8.1.a
  "model" requirement for on-prem deployments. Editable at
  `/ui/nodes/:id`. `UpsertNode`'s `DO UPDATE SET` clause is explicit
  about which columns the collector owns; the new columns are absent
  from it by design.
- **ADR-0008** ([#55](https://github.com/sthalbert/Argos/pull/55)) —
  SecNumCloud v3.2 chapter 8 coverage. Maps every §8.1 sub-clause to a
  concrete Argos column or explicit cross-reference (licenses →
  Dependency-Track via `containers[].image`; §8.2 and §8.5 are
  procedural / out of system scope). DICT
  (disponibilité / intégrité / confidentialité / traçabilité) classification
  will land on Namespace + Workload in a later release at the Application
  abstraction, per the Mercator model.

### Fixed

- **Detail pages resolve parent names instead of UUIDs**
  ([#58](https://github.com/sthalbert/Argos/pull/58)) —
  `/ui/namespaces/:id` previously had no Cluster row at all;
  `/ui/nodes/:id` showed the cluster id as a truncated UUID;
  `/ui/workloads/:id` did the same for namespace. Each page now
  resolves the parent and renders a `<Link>` with its name. The
  Workload breadcrumb also gains cluster + namespace hops so the
  drill-down trail reads *"Workloads / <cluster> / <namespace> / this
  workload"* instead of dead-ending.
- **Namespace pods table shows workload name**
  ([#59](https://github.com/sthalbert/Argos/pull/59)) — the Workload
  column in `/ui/namespaces/:id`'s pods table rendered each pod's
  `workload_id` as a UUID link. Now renders the workload's name and
  kind (`web-frontend · Deployment`) by resolving against the
  in-scope workloads fetch — no extra network call.

### Schema migrations

- `00019_namespace_curated_metadata.sql` — adds 5 columns on
  `namespaces`.
- `00020_node_curated_metadata.sql` — adds 6 columns (5 curated +
  `hardware_model`) on `nodes`.

Both are additive; existing rows get NULL for the new columns and the
JSONB defaults to `{}`. No data rewrite, no downtime.

### Upgrading

```bash
# From v0.1.0. Keep your existing ARGOS_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD — the
# bootstrap only fires when no admin exists, so it's a no-op here.
make build VERSION=0.1.1
# Point at the same DSN as v0.1.0; ARGOS_AUTO_MIGRATE=true (default)
# applies 00019 + 00020 on startup.
./bin/argosd
```

No client-side break: new columns show up as `null` on existing rows
and the UI renders an "Edit" placeholder until an editor fills them in.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-19 — "Canopus"

First tagged release. Argos is a Kubernetes-aware CMDB aligned with the
ANSSI **SecNumCloud (SNC)** qualification framework, replacing the
Kubernetes-scoped portion of Mercator. Named after the principal star
of the old *Argo Navis* constellation — a classical navigation marker.

### Highlights

- Multi-cluster polling collector mirrors a full Kubernetes inventory
  (nodes, namespaces, pods, workloads, services, ingresses, PVs, PVCs)
  into PostgreSQL and reconciles rows that disappear from the live
  listing.
- REST API is OpenAPI 3.1 contract-first with RFC 7807 errors, cursor
  pagination, and merge-patch updates.
- Dual-path authentication: humans log in with local password **or**
  OIDC (authorization-code flow with PKCE + nonce + state); machines
  carry admin-minted bearer tokens (argon2id-hashed, prefix-indexed).
- Four fixed roles — `admin` / `editor` / `auditor` / `viewer` — wired
  through the existing scope checks.
- React/TypeScript SPA embedded in the binary; admin panel, audit log
  viewer, component search, and inline cluster-metadata editor.
- Append-only audit log captures every write + every admin-panel read.
- Prometheus `/metrics` exposes per-cluster collector + HTTP counters.

### Architecture — ADRs

- **ADR-0001** — CMDB for SNC using the Kubernetes API as source of truth.
- **ADR-0002** — Mapping Kubernetes kinds onto the ANSSI cartography layers.
- **ADR-0003** — Workload polymorphism (Deployment / StatefulSet / DaemonSet
  on one table, discriminated by `kind`).
- **ADR-0004** — Ingress layer classification.
- **ADR-0005** — Multi-cluster collector topology
  (`ARGOS_COLLECTOR_CLUSTERS`).
- **ADR-0006** — Web UI bundled into argosd; curated-metadata columns.
- **ADR-0007** — Auth & RBAC (sessions + OIDC + bearer tokens).

### API & data model

- Nine resource kinds: **Cluster**, **Namespace**, **Node**, **Pod**,
  **Workload** (poly over Deployment / StatefulSet / DaemonSet),
  **Service**, **Ingress**, **PersistentVolume**,
  **PersistentVolumeClaim**. All carry a `layer` field derived from
  ADR-0002.
- FK chain `clusters → namespaces/nodes/persistent_volumes → pods /
  workloads / services / ingresses / persistent_volume_claims`, all
  `ON DELETE CASCADE`. Pods also carry a nullable `workload_id` FK to
  their top-level controller (`ON DELETE SET NULL`); PVCs carry a
  nullable `bound_volume_id` FK (same semantics).
- Pods and Workloads include a `containers` JSONB column for SBOM /
  CVE workflows. Nodes carry a Mercator-aligned field set (role, cloud
  identity, OS stack, capacity + allocatable, conditions, taints).
  Services and Ingresses carry a `load_balancer` JSONB column so
  on-prem VIPs (MetalLB, Kube-VIP, hardware LBs) surface alongside
  cloud-provisioned ones.
- Filter endpoints for incident response:
  - `GET /v1/workloads?image=…` and `GET /v1/pods?image=…` —
    case-insensitive substring match over every container image.
  - `GET /v1/pods?node_name=…` — powers the "if this node dies, which
    pods are lost?" view.
- Merge-patch `PATCH /v1/clusters/{id}` supports **display_name,
  environment, provider, region, api_endpoint, labels, owner,
  criticality, notes, runbook_url, annotations**. Collector writes
  only `kubernetes_version`, so operator annotations are preserved
  across polls.

### Collector

- Polling-based; each tick refreshes the API-server version and lists
  every catalogued kind cluster-wide. Default 5 minute interval,
  configurable.
- Reconciliation (`ARGOS_COLLECTOR_RECONCILE=true`, default on) deletes
  rows that disappear from the live listing so the CMDB mirrors
  ground truth — required for ANSSI cartography fidelity. Runs only
  after a successful list so a transient Kubernetes error never wipes
  the store.
- Multi-cluster via `ARGOS_COLLECTOR_CLUSTERS` (JSON array of
  `{name, kubeconfig}` tuples); legacy single-cluster env vars still
  work. Empty kubeconfig falls back to in-cluster config.
- Exposes Prometheus counters and last-poll gauges per
  `(cluster, resource)`.

### Auth (ADR-0007)

- **Local login**: `POST /v1/auth/login` → server-side session cookie
  (HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict, 8h sliding).
- **OIDC**: `GET /v1/auth/oidc/authorize` → IdP →
  `GET /v1/auth/oidc/callback`; authorization-code flow with PKCE
  (S256) + nonce + state. Shadow users keyed on `(issuer, sub)`;
  first-login role is `viewer` — admins promote manually (authorization
  is never claim-driven).
- **Machine tokens**: `Authorization: Bearer argos_pat_<prefix>_<suffix>`;
  argon2id-hashed at rest, 8-char prefix for O(1) lookup, plaintext
  shown once at creation (GitHub-PAT pattern). Minted in the admin UI.
- **First-run bootstrap**: creates a single `admin` user when none
  exists; password comes from `ARGOS_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` or a
  random 16-char string printed once to the startup log. Forced
  rotation on first login.
- Role → scope mapping: `admin` carries everything, `editor` =
  `read + write`, `auditor` = `read + audit`, `viewer` = `read`.

### Audit log

- `audit_events` table is append-only; the audit middleware observes
  every state-changing call plus every `/v1/admin/*` read and records
  actor + verb + target + status + source IP.
- Password / token / OIDC client-secret fields are scrubbed before
  the row is written.
- `GET /v1/admin/audit` with filters for actor, resource, action, and
  time window. `audit` scope (admin or auditor).

### Web UI (ADR-0006)

- Embedded React/TypeScript SPA at `/ui/` (build-tag `noui` disables
  the embed for backend-only builds).
- List and detail pages for every resource kind; **Cluster →
  Namespace → Workload → Pod** and **Cluster → Node** drill-downs.
- Node detail renders the full Mercator picture: identity, OS &
  runtime, networking, resources (capacity vs allocatable), conditions
  with per-row health colouring, taints, labels — plus an
  impact-analysis callout of affected pods grouped by workload.
- Ingress detail surfaces the load-balancer block first, then rules
  and TLS.
- Component search at `/ui/search/image` with URL-persisted query.
- Admin panel at `/ui/admin/`: Users / Machine tokens / Active
  sessions / Audit. Auditors see only the Audit tab; admins see all.
- Inline "Ownership & context" editor on `/ui/clusters/:id` for
  editors and admins — edits environment, provider, region, labels,
  owner, criticality, runbook URL, notes, and annotations without the
  collector clobbering them.

### Operations

- Dockerfile: three-stage build (Node UI builder → Go builder →
  distroless runtime), static binary, runs as UID 65532.
- `deploy/` ships reference Kustomize manifests for running argosd in
  a Kubernetes cluster cataloguing itself via in-cluster
  ServiceAccount (`list` on every catalogued kind). Multi-cluster
  variant documented in `deploy/README.md`.
- `/metrics` mounted unauthenticated on the main mux (Prometheus
  scrape convention): HTTP request / duration counters, collector
  upsert / reconcile / error counters, per-`(cluster, resource)`
  last-poll gauges, `argos_build_info`.
- CI (GitHub Actions): conventional-commit title check, `go vet` /
  `go build` / `go test -race` against a Postgres service container,
  `golangci-lint`, UI `npm run build` + typecheck, Docker image
  build verification.

### Known limitations

- REST + DB contracts may change incompatibly before `v1.0.0`. Pin to
  this tag for stability.
- Only the **Cluster** kind carries curated-metadata columns in
  `v0.1.0`; the same pattern will land on namespaces / nodes /
  workloads in a follow-up.
- No snapshots / time-travel yet (longer-horizon roadmap item from
  ADR-0001).
- No built-in MFA on the local password path; customers who need it
  should federate through their OIDC provider (which already gives
  every argosd instance MFA as a side-effect).
