# ADR-0012: End-of-life enrichment via endoflife.date

## Status

**Proposed** | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded | Deprecated

## Context

Argos catalogues software versions across every entity in the CMDB: `kubernetes_version` on clusters, `kubelet_version` / `kube_proxy_version` / `container_runtime_version` / `kernel_version` / `os_image` on nodes, and container `image` tags on pods and workloads. Today none of these carry lifecycle information — an operator looking at the inventory cannot tell which components are end-of-life (EOL), approaching EOL, or still under active support without checking each version manually.

SecNumCloud chapter 8 (asset management) and ANSSI best practices expect the CMDB to surface obsolescence risk. Running EOL software is a known vector for unpatched CVEs and a recurring finding in SNC audits.

The [endoflife.date](https://endoflife.date) project maintains a community-curated, machine-readable database of lifecycle dates for 450+ products — including Kubernetes, Ubuntu, Debian, Alpine Linux, RHEL, containerd, Docker, PostgreSQL, and most software Argos already inventories. It exposes a free, unauthenticated JSON API:

- `GET /api/all.json` — list of all tracked product identifiers.
- `GET /api/{product}.json` — all release cycles with `eol`, `support`, `lts`, `latest`, `releaseDate` per cycle.
- `GET /api/{product}/{cycle}.json` — single cycle detail.

No API key, no rate-limit header (community-funded, fair-use expected), responses are small JSON arrays cached at the CDN edge.

## Decision

**Add an EOL enrichment subsystem to argosd** that periodically queries the endoflife.date API, matches inventoried versions against known product cycles, and writes structured EOL annotations on the corresponding CMDB entities.

### Matchable products (v1 scope)

| CMDB entity | Field(s)                   | endoflife.date product(s) | Version extraction |
|-------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Cluster     | `kubernetes_version`       | `kubernetes`              | strip leading `v`, match major.minor cycle |
| Node        | `kubelet_version`          | `kubernetes`              | same as above (kubelet tracks k8s release) |
| Node        | `container_runtime_version`| `containerd`, `cri-o`    | parse `containerd://1.7.x` → product `containerd`, cycle `1.7` |
| Node        | `os_image`                 | `ubuntu`, `debian`, `alpine`, `rhel`, `rocky-linux`, `amazon-linux`, … | parse distro name + version from the free-text `os_image` string |
| Node        | `kernel_version`           | `linux`                   | match major.minor cycle |

Container images (pods/workloads) are **out of v1 scope**. Image tags are unstructured (`nginx:1.25-alpine`, `myapp:latest`, `sha256:…`) and matching them to endoflife.date products requires a registry-aware parser and a heuristic mapping layer. This is a natural v2 extension.

### Enrichment model

The enrichment writes **annotations** on the entity, using a reserved `argos.io/eol.*` key namespace:

```json
{
  "argos.io/eol.kubernetes": {
    "product": "kubernetes",
    "cycle": "1.28",
    "eol": "2025-06-28",
    "eol_status": "eol",
    "support": "2025-04-28",
    "latest": "1.28.15",
    "checked_at": "2026-04-24T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "argos.io/eol.containerd": {
    "product": "containerd",
    "cycle": "1.6",
    "eol": "2024-02-16",
    "eol_status": "eol",
    "latest": "1.6.36",
    "checked_at": "2026-04-24T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

`eol_status` is a derived enum for UI/query convenience:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `eol` | Current date is past `eol` date. |
| `approaching_eol` | Current date is within a configurable window before `eol` (default: 90 days). |
| `supported` | Still under active support. |
| `unknown` | Product or cycle not found in endoflife.date. |

The annotations key is namespaced per product so a single node can carry multiple EOL signals (e.g. OS and container runtime simultaneously).

### Architecture

```

The enricher is a **separate goroutine** in argosd, independent of the collector. It runs on its own interval (default: 24h — lifecycle data changes slowly). Each tick:

1. Queries the store for all distinct `(product, version)` tuples currently in the CMDB.
2. Fetches the matching endoflife.date cycles (with an in-memory cache per product, TTL = enricher interval, so repeated cycles don't re-fetch).
3. Computes `eol_status` for each tuple.
4. Writes the `argos.io/eol.*` annotations via `UpdateCluster` / `UpdateNode` merge-patch (existing annotations are preserved; only the `argos.io/eol.*` keys are overwritten).

The enricher never deletes CMDB entities — it only annotates. A failed endoflife.date fetch logs a warning and skips that product; stale annotations carry `checked_at` so the UI can show freshness.

### Configuration

```
ARGOS_EOL_ENABLED=true                    # default: false
ARGOS_EOL_INTERVAL=24h                    # default: 24h
ARGOS_EOL_APPROACHING_DAYS=90             # default: 90
ARGOS_EOL_BASE_URL=https://endoflife.date # default; override for mirror/proxy
```

Disabled by default so the feature is opt-in. When `ARGOS_EOL_ENABLED=false`, no goroutine is started, no outbound HTTP calls are made.

### API surface

No new endpoints. EOL data is exposed through the existing entity responses — the `annotations` field already ships in `GET /v1/clusters`, `GET /v1/nodes`, etc. Consumers filter on the `argos.io/eol.*` keys.

A future enhancement can add query parameters (`?eol_status=eol`, `?eol_before=2026-06-01`) as convenience filters, but v1 relies on client-side filtering or the UI's annotation display.

### UI surface

The UI reads the `argos.io/eol.*` annotations and renders:

- A **badge** on the entity card: red for `eol`, orange for `approaching_eol`, green for `supported`, grey for `unknown`.
- A **tooltip** or expandable row showing the cycle, EOL date, latest available version, and `checked_at`.
- A **dashboard widget** (future): count of EOL / approaching-EOL entities across the inventory for audit reporting.

### Push collector

The push collector (`argos-collector`) does **not** run the enricher. Enrichment is centralised in argosd — it reads from the store and writes back. Push-collected clusters are enriched the same way as pull-collected ones; no change to the push collector binary.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **POS-001**: Operators see EOL risk at a glance in the CMDB, without leaving the tool or cross-referencing external sites.
- **POS-002**: SNC auditors can query annotations to produce an obsolescence report — a direct input to chapter 8 compliance evidence.
- **POS-003**: The annotation model is extensible — future enrichers (CVE databases, compliance tags) can use the same `argos.io/*` namespace pattern.
- **POS-004**: No schema migration — annotations are already a JSONB column on clusters and nodes.
- **POS-005**: Opt-in by default — environments with no outbound internet (air-gap) are unaffected.

### Negative

- **NEG-001**: argosd makes outbound HTTPS calls to `endoflife.date`. In strict-egress environments, operators must allowlist the domain or configure `ARGOS_EOL_BASE_URL` to point to an internal mirror.
- **NEG-002**: endoflife.date is community-maintained. Data accuracy depends on upstream contributors. Mitigated by `checked_at` timestamps and the ability to override annotations manually via `PATCH`.
- **NEG-003**: Version extraction from free-text fields (`os_image`, `container_runtime_version`) is heuristic. Edge cases (custom OS images, non-standard version strings) may produce `unknown` status. The parser must be conservative — `unknown` is better than a wrong match.
- **NEG-004**: The annotation payload increases the JSON size of entity responses. For nodes with 3-4 matched products, this adds ~1 KB per node — negligible at expected scale.

## Alternatives Considered

### Store EOL data in dedicated columns

- **Description**: Add `eol_date`, `eol_status` columns to `clusters`, `nodes`, etc.
- **Rejection reason**: Rigid — each new matchable product requires a migration. The annotations JSONB is already designed for this kind of extensible metadata. Dedicated columns may make sense later for high-cardinality query patterns (e.g. `WHERE eol_status = 'eol'`), but v1 can use JSONB operators.

### Run enrichment as a separate sidecar / CronJob

- **Description**: A standalone binary or Kubernetes CronJob that reads the CMDB via the API, fetches endoflife.date, and patches entities back.
- **Rejection reason**: Adds a second deployment target, a second token to manage, and network round-trips through the API for what is a store-to-store operation. The in-process goroutine is simpler and consistent with the collector model. If isolation is needed later (e.g. for a plugin system), the enricher package can be extracted — same trade-off as ADR-0005 ALT-003/ALT-004 for the collector.

### Use the NIST NVD or another CVE database instead

- **Description**: Enrich with CVE counts per version rather than EOL dates.
- **Rejection reason**: Complementary, not a substitute. EOL status is a lifecycle signal (is this version still receiving patches?); CVE count is a vulnerability signal (how many known issues exist?). endoflife.date is simpler to integrate (no API key, small payloads, stable schema). CVE enrichment is a natural follow-up that can reuse the same annotation model.

## Implementation Notes

- **IMP-001**: Create `internal/eol/` package. Core types: `Product`, `Cycle`, `Status` enum, `Annotation` struct. `Enricher` struct with `Run(ctx)` method (same pattern as `collector.Collector`).
- **IMP-002**: Create `internal/eol/endoflife/` sub-package: HTTP client for endoflife.date API with in-memory product cache, configurable base URL, timeout, and `http.Client` injection for testing.
- **IMP-003**: Create `internal/eol/matcher/` sub-package: version extraction and product-matching logic. Start with `KubernetesVersionMatcher`, `ContainerRuntimeMatcher`, `OSImageMatcher`, `KernelMatcher`. Each implements a `Match(fieldValue string) (product, cycle string, ok bool)` interface. Unit-test with real-world `os_image` and `container_runtime_version` strings from diverse clusters.
- **IMP-004**: Wire the enricher in `cmd/argosd/main.go` behind `ARGOS_EOL_ENABLED`. Start after the store is ready, stop on context cancellation (same as collector goroutines).
- **IMP-005**: Add Prometheus metrics: `argos_eol_enrichments_total{product, status}`, `argos_eol_errors_total{product, phase}`, `argos_eol_last_run_timestamp_seconds`.
- **IMP-006**: UI: add EOL badges to cluster detail and node detail pages. Read from `annotations["argos.io/eol.*"]`.
- **IMP-007**: Tests: unit tests for matchers, integration test that starts the enricher against a fake HTTP server returning canned endoflife.date responses and verifies annotations land in the store.
